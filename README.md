Java program that mocks an airline reservation system.

Utilizes MySQL as the backend database which is filled with bogus flight data such as airplane names, route numbers, departing and arriving airports, departure and arrival times, and reservation information.

The front end lets the user sign in or create a new account which is stored in the MySQL database and then is able to search flights and current reservations.
